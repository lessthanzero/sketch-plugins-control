# 🏀  Sketch Plugins getter and updater 

For now, just a shell script. It clones repos (must be defined inside), adds them as gitup bookmarks.
After that, 'gitup -u' command handles the update process.

Uses [gitup](https://github.com/git-up/GitUp/) CLI heavily.

## To be done:
- Plugins list in a separate .csv or .md file
- Gitup existance check and installation
- GUI 🎉

Inspired by [Sketch Toolbox](https://github.com/buzzfeed/Sketch-Toolbox)

*Important*: it wasn't properly tested yet
